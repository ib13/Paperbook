Part 1
We have installed antd that provide material themes. It has layouts to use
Using axios we can make get or post request
componentDidMount() - This is called everytime we mount this component
We will need cors-headers for making request to the server
otherwise axios cannot get request from the server
read installation steps for setting up corsheaders
We install react-router-dom for navigation between webpages
routes.js has all our routes
Link allow to navigate better like a tag

Part 2
Instead of writing different types of view we can use viewset to use everything as one
event.preventDefault(); is used so that form donot refresh on submit itself
requestType can be either post or put
if parameters not written then default is null
