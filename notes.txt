Part 1
We have installed antd that provide material themes. It has layouts to use
Using axios we can make get or post request
componentDidMount() - This is called everytime we mount this component
We will need cors-headers for making request to the server
otherwise axios cannot get request from the server
read installation steps for setting up corsheaders
We install react-router-dom for navigation between webpages
routes.js has all our routes
Link allow to navigate better like a tag

Part 2
Instead of writing different types of view we can use viewset to use everything as one
event.preventDefault(); is used so that form donot refresh on submit itself
requestType can be either post or put
if parameters not written then default is null

Part 3
Here we store a token in browser's local storage and check if token is present then logged in else logged out
store is used to maintain state for entire app
it consist of actions and reducers
action contain what should take place
when working with actions we always include action type
reducer based on the action takes the present state and return new state
in auth we import actionTypes in which a function is executed depending on action type.
every method returns a object having type attribute
We donot store token,expirationDate in store as we donot need this to refresh or reload every time a state changes
in utility.js we have oldObject and updatedProperties and with we replace the keys in oldObject with updated keys in updatedProperties
reducer takes in the state and action and return updated state
updateObject takes state,{} (properties we want to update)
loading is done till authentication is done

we define actions, actions are executed with dispatch, they return an object which contain type with other fields
when that action is dispatched it is recieved in the reducer as parameters
it looks at which method to execute depending on the action and that method returns a new state
redux-thunk is a middleware
we use createStore for creating store
we use Provider to wrap our app component and mention store
to connect our app with the state we use connect
it will grab the store we created and allow us to access the state
mapStateToProps maps state to props so that we can pass them through html tags
...props will pass the state converted as props to CustomLayout
